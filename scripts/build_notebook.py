- **Each row is one car the driver drove, and it carries that car's grid slot and result.**
  This was confirmed on the 1951 French GP (raceId 828). Fangio has one row for car 8, grid 7,
  **1st**: Fagioli's car, which Fangio took over and won in. He has a second row for his own
  car 24, grid 1, 11th. Fagioli has rows for the same two cars. So in shared drives, `grid`
  describes the *car*, not where that driver started.
- **Most duplicates are classic 1950s shared drives.** 82 of the 85 pairs have `grid > 0` in every
  row. The most common pattern is *R + classified* with the same constructor (46 pairs): the
  driver's own car retired, and they finished the race in a teammate's car. In 8 pairs, both
  cars the driver drove were classified.
- **3 pairs are not shared drives.** They have `grid = 0` in both rows: *F + F* in 1958 and 1978,
  and *W + W* in 1962. The driver was entered in two cars and started neither. These overlap
  with the non-starter question in 4.1.
- **21 of the 85 pairs come from the Indianapolis 500** (1950, 1953, 1954). In about half of them
  (11 of 21) the constructors differ, because drivers relieved each other across teams. This links the shared-drive
  rule to the open Indy 500 exclusion decision.
- **Why it matters for the target.** With shared drives, one driver can have both a podium row
  and a non-podium row in the same race (Fangio 1951 above). Any rule for these rows has to say
  what `podium` means for such a driver. That is an open decision and is not settled here."""),

    md("""### 6.1 Duplicate `(raceId, driverId)` rows in `results`

#### Decision record

**Problem.** 85 driver–race pairs have more than one `results` row (176 rows, 1950–1978; see 3.4 and 4.2).
Our grain needs exactly one row per driver per race.

**Options considered**

| Option | Rule | Assessment |
|---|---|---|
| A | Keep the row with the best `positionOrder` | Chooses rows **using the target**: a driver who took over a winning car gets the podium. This is label leakage and inflates podium rates. |
| **B** | **Keep one row per pair chosen by pre-race fields only** (`grid > 0`, then lowest grid, then lowest `resultId`) | Target-blind: the choice never looks at positions, points or status, so it cannot favour podium rows. |
| C | Drop every duplicated pair | Deletes real race entries, including genuine podiums, and leaves holes in those races. |
| D | Aggregate rows (e.g. best result, mean grid) | Creates a row that never existed: its features and label come from different cars. |

**Choice: B**, applied in this order:
1. Pairs where no row has `grid > 0` are non-starters. They are left untouched here and logged as
   *resolved by non-starter filter*, a separate step that comes later.
2. Keep the row with `grid > 0`.
3. If several rows have `grid > 0`, keep the lowest grid.
4. Final deterministic tie-break: the lowest `resultId`.

**Why.** B is **not** "keep the car the driver started in"; the data cannot tell us that. **Every resolved
pair has more than one row with `grid > 0`.** Step 2 never decides a real pair (see the step counts below:
0 × *single started row*). In a shared drive, every row carries *that car's* grid slot, not the driver's.
So the lowest grid is a **target-blind heuristic for the driver's primary entry**: the
better-placed car they are listed with. What B guarantees is that the row is chosen without looking at the
outcome, unlike rule A, and is fully deterministic. It does not guarantee that the kept row is the car the
driver started in. *(Assumption: the lowest grid usually corresponds to the primary entry; Unknown how often.)*

**Known misattributions (accepted).** Here the heuristic keeps a car the driver took over, not the one they started in:
- **Fagioli, 1951 French GP (raceId 828).** He started car 8 from grid 7. Fangio took it over and won.
  Fagioli then drove Fangio's car 24 (grid 1, classified 11th). B keeps the car-24 row (resultId 20188, P11)
  instead of car 8 (resultId 19918, P1).
- **Brooks, 1957 British GP (raceId 780).** Moss took over the car Brooks started in (grid 3) and won.
  Brooks drove Moss's car (grid 1, classified 12th). B keeps resultId 20293 (P12) instead of 18806 (P1).

In both cases the label changes from podium to non-podium. The log column
`lowest_grid_differs_from_lowest_resultId` flags the 27 pairs where the lowest grid and the lowest `resultId`
disagree. The lowest `resultId` is often the originally entered car, but it is only partial evidence,
so these flagged pairs are where further misattributions are most likely.

- **Rows.** `results` goes from 26,759 to 26,671 rows: 88 rows dropped across 82 resolved pairs.
  The 3 all-non-starter pairs (6 rows) remain until the non-starter filter runs. The raw table is unchanged.
- **Steps used.** 81 pairs were resolved by *lowest grid* and 1 by the *lowest resultId* tie-break.
  *Single started row* never occurs in the real data; only the unit test covers it. Every resolved pair has
  `grid > 0` on all its rows, which is why step 3 does almost all the work.
- **Sensitivity to the rule.** Rules A and B keep a different row in 56 of 82 pairs, but the **podium label
  differs in only 17 pairs**. All 17 go the same way: rule A gives a podium and rule B does not
  (22 vs 5 podium labels in these pairs). So rule A would add 17 podium labels, which is the inflation
  described above. All 17 are from 1950–1960, inside the training period; validation and test rows are unaffected.
- **Where the heuristic misattributes.** 4 of the 17 flips are flagged pairs (lowest grid ≠ lowest resultId).
  Two of them are the known misattributions listed in the decision record (Fagioli 1951, Brooks 1957).
  For these drivers, B keeps the car they took over, not the one they started in. This is accepted for now.
  A possible follow-up (Experiment) is to put the lowest-resultId tie-break before the lowest-grid one and re-measure."""),
